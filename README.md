Q: Can I write a chess engine that I cannot beat?

A: Yes, it only took an afternoon. (I am bad at chess.)

Limitations:
- client:
    - can't play as black
    - can't premove
    - can't under-promote
    - is not good
- engine:
    - does not avoid draw by threefold repetition or 50-move rule
    - does not know openings
    - does not know endgames
    - is not good
